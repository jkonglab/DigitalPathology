This folder is a place to put any extra files to support the algorithm.
Typically algorithms will have model files, function files, etc.  This is the place to put them.


The invocation code in example_algorithm.py in the outer folder (/algorithms/python3) will include these files and call into these files in this folder.  This keeps the invocation code clean of junk and allows a more streamlined implementation.
